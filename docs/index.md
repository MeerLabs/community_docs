# Welcome to the Community Documents site
The Qitmeer community offers documentation and tutorials on Qitmeer, which is maintained and developed by blockchain and open-source enthusiasts.

Qitmeer is a blockDAG-based public blockchain infrastructure built on PoW. It features a UTXO-based account system and also supports a compatible EVM for the convenient deployment of smart contracts. Qitmeer has a roadmap to support L2 zk rollup and other consensus algorithms in the future.

## Name Conventions

Name conventions used in the Qitmeer blockchain system and networks are as follows:

* **Qitmeer**: the name of the BlockDAG architecture with POW consensus based qitmeer blockchain infrastructure. It provides a stable, secure, and fair decentralized infrastructure for upper layer applications.

* **QNG**: an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchain layer that runs seamlessly with “qitmeer” infrastructure. It provides an easy interface to deploy any EVM compatible dAPPs.

* **Amana**: layer 2 solution for QNG, designed to provide high performance and scalability. Currently, Amana is only available on testnet and is based on a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm.
